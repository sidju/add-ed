//! Add-Ed is a library implementing the parsing and runtime for Ed in rust.
//!
//! It exports two traits, Buffer and UI, which define the exchangeable parts of the editor.
//!
//! An implementation of the UI trait is needed to support the 'g' command and similar, DummyUI.
//! It is used for macro execution, by taking prepared input from a input list rather than prompting the user.
//!
//! Since the buffer is rather complex a standard Buffer implementation is included in the feature "vecbuffer".
//! It is recommended to compare the behaviour of any Buffer implementation to the VecBuffer in addition to the api tests.
//!
//! An example of how to use this library is in src/bin/classic.rs
